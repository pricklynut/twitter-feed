NOTES
------------

- I don't understand what purposes serves "id" parameter ("unique identifier of a request").
- Can't get access to twitter developer account, so use "mock" class.
To use real api need to fill twitterApi params section and replace
`TwitterApiExchangeMock` by `TwitterApiExchange` class in "components" section of config.
